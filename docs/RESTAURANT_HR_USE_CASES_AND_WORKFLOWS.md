## 2. Workflow: Employee Onboarding (Day 0 → Day 30)

### Overview
When a new employee is hired at any of your 12 restaurant locations, a cascade of documents must be assigned, completed, and tracked — many before the employee's first scheduled shift.

### Trigger
- **Event:** New hire record created (accepted offer / added to system)
- **Auto-assign engine evaluates:** Location, job title, age, employment type (FT/PT), role (FOH/BOH/Management)

### Day -3 to Day 0 (Pre-First Day)
